# HQP_DualArmMobile
Robostar robot controller for using HQP and task-transition algorithm

The base of this code is TSID algorithm of Gepetto team in CNRS.

I added some functions for avoiding singularity and obstacle avoidance in real-time.

This module is needed V-Rep which is an robotics simulator with Vortex Engine.
